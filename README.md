# CSCI-442-Project-5-Memory-Management
##### using C++

### Created a simulation of a memory manager using FIFO and LRU replacement strategies, and calculated the number of memory accesses, page faults, and free frames remaining in the system.

#### 1. Implemented two different page-replacement strategies: First In First Out(FIFO) and Least Recently Used(LRU).
#### 2. Implemented calculation of various statistics, including the number of memory accesses, page faults, and free frames remaining in the system.
