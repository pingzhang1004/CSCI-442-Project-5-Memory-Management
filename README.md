# CSCI-442-Project-5-Memory-Management
##### * using C++ programming language 
##### * I can provide the source code for the interview!
##### * The course project code is not allowed to be published onlineï¼Œbut I am happy to share the ideas of implementation and running results of my algorithm!
### Created a simulation of a memory manager using FIFO and LRU replacement strategies, and calculated the number of memory accesses, page faults, and free frames remaining in the system.

#### 1. Implemented two different page-replacement strategies: First In First Out(FIFO) and Least Recently Used(LRU).
#### 2. Implemented calculation of various statistics, including the number of memory accesses, page faults, and free frames remaining in the system.
